    <h2>üåê Backstory</h2>
    <p>In the forgotten hollows of the <strong>Jade Chasm</strong>, beneath root and ruin, the <em>geckokin</em> once lived in harmony, keepers of deep-time knowledge stored in small, volcanic stone tomes. These tomes, carved in a long-lost language called <strong>Scalescript</strong>, held the secrets of nature, balance, and the ancient Reptilian Gods.</p>

    <p>Nual was a humble archivist‚Äîsmall, soft-spoken, and unnoticed. But when fire rained from the sky and scattered the geckokin temples, Nual was chosen in visions by the Reptilian Ancients. His mission: <em>journey across the lands and return each sacred tome to its rightful temple</em>, reawakening the slumbering spirits of nature.</p>

    <p>He now wanders the realm, wearing a harness that carries 4‚Äì5 hand-sized stone tomes, bound in vine and hide. These tomes are alive with ancient magic, glowing faintly when rituals are performed. Nual‚Äôs travels are slow but meaningful, and his connection with the old world grows deeper with each step.</p>
